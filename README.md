### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working [@lafourchette](https://github.com/lafourchette) in Paris and having fun 🍔🍽️🥖🥐

💬 Ask me about:
- Automation
- Test design & test procedure development
- Tools: Selenium, Appium, Jenkins, AWS, Docker, ELK Stack, HP QTP & UFT, SoapUI, Ranorex
- Java, C# & PHP

🌱 I’m playing with Container Orchestration and in my spare time trying to figure out how to 🧵 3D print stuff 

📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpolaru/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Olaru_MP)

🟪 Also take a look at [my ugly website that I built in 2016 and haven't updated since](http://marcelolaru.com/) 

⚡ Fun fact: 
- I eat all my vegetables 🥒.
- Pineapple on pizza 🍕 should be considered a crime by the Geneve convention.
- Only fruit that should be on pizza is tomatoes 🍅.
